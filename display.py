            WELCOME TO THE DICE GAME (PIG)

            RULES :

            - Objective: Be the first to reach a certain point total, usually 100.
            - Players: Two or more.
            - Gameplay:
                Players take turns rolling a single die.
                On each turn, a player repeatedly rolls the die until they decide to "hold" or roll a 1.
            - Scoring:
                Rolling a 1 ends the turn with no points scored.
                Any other number adds to the player's turn total.
            - Holding: 
                At any point during their turn, a player can choose to "hold", keeping all points accumulated.
            - Winning: 
                The first player to reach the target score (e.g., 100) wins. All players may get one final turn to try to surpass the leading player's score in some variations.
